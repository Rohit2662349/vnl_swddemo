# vnl_swddemo
The code contains a generalised swd state machine that is build on STM32f765IGTx using Keil IDE. The code works on console over UART1/UART3 which can be accessed using teraterm(115200 baud, 1 stopbit , no parity). There is a log file attached which gives the details of steps we have followed and where we get stucked following the sequence for flash write/erase.
NOTE: Please open the swd logs file in notepad++ for a better view.
